This is a separate release of a subset of the available classes in the toxiclibs library.

Only the following package is included:

toxi.physics.*

This library also depends on the following other packages,
get them via: http://toxiclibs.googlecode.com/downloads/list

toxi.geom (toxiclibscore-0013 release or later)
toxi.math (toxiclibscore-0013 release or later)

If you're going to use these classes for Processing projects,
first drop the "verletphysics" folder into the "libraries" folder of your
Processing sketchbook and ensure the above listed dependent libraries
are installed there too. You'll then need to restart Processing in order
for it to find this new library.

Source code is available via SVN, instructions over here:
http://code.google.com/p/toxiclibs/source

JavaDocs are available in the "docs" folder of each download.
