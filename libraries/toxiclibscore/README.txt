This is a separate release of a subset of the available classes in the toxiclibs library.

Only the following packages are included. These form the core functionality of the libraries
and are required for all other downloadable packages:

toxi.geom
toxi.geom.util
toxi.math
toxi.math.conversion
toxi.math.noise
toxi.math.waves
toxi.util.datatypes

If you're going to use these classes for Processing projects,
first drop the entire "toxiclibscore" folder into the "libraries" folder
of your Processing sketchbook. You'll then need to restart Processing
in order for it to find this new library.

Source code is available via SVN, instructions over here:
http://code.google.com/p/toxiclibs/source

JavaDocs are available in the "docs" folder of each download.

Have fun!
