      <h3>Why servlets</h3>
      <p>Tree like navigation elements are widely used in web sites designs.
      Most popular are JavaScript based implementations, since they have very sleek
      appearance and&nbsp; do not require server access for their traversing. Some
      limited drag and drop operations are possible too. However, due JS performance and memory limitation,
      they can't handle too big trees (usually 1000 nodes
      is limit). Even more sleeker can be a Java applet or ActiveX control
      implementation, however they require certain type of VM or browser. So, if
      your requirements to have dynamic or very big tree or supporting any
      browser and platform, then server side tree controls can be
      only solution.
      Server side implementation can be based on any server side scripting, like
      PHP, ASP, or JSP. However this particular example is servlet based, just
      to demonstrate power ness of servlet technology.</p>
      <h3>Implementation notes&nbsp;</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>This is reference implementation of tree view for a tree defined in XML file</li>
        <li>You need to implement a class implementing interface Traversable to implement any other tree</li>
        <li>Note, object null is considered as root element&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Name of framework servlet rogatkin.servlet.Dispatcher, however it can be subclassed&nbsp;</li>
        <li>This servlet reads init file treeview.properties where defined:
- WorkerPrefix - package prefix of tree view implementation, can be selected any desirable,
has to have . at end
- TEMPLATEROOT - resource root, can be file, http, or class root related
- treeimages - subservlet or relative path to images used in tree
- DefaultServant - default sub servlet (optional)
- XMLTREE - used a particular implementation, for example XML file</li>
        <li>demrog.jar and implementation classes have to be added in class path or placed in lib in 
  context directory when servlet container used</li>
        <li>For custom icon or/and link use<br>
          side_url=http://www.gena.crocodile.org<br>
          side_logo=http://www.gena.crocodile.org/gena-logo.gif</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Where is a problem</h3>
      <p>Generally number of states can reach O(n!) at traversing of a tree,
      where n is number of nodes. Obviously it makes impossible for web crawlers
      to traverse entire tree. So, such popular crawlers as google, simple stop
      at certain point and significant part of web site can be left not indexed.
      For example this page you will never see in any search engines. I know
      only one crawler designed by IBM research center which capable to index
      most of pages navigated over a tree control.&nbsp; Therefore if you need
      to get your page indexed reachable through a tree control, then provide all links in hidden &lt;div&gt; on
      first page for all such page. Since search engines will provide a wrong
      referer for such pages, should have JavaScript,
      which checks if a page displayed as standalone and automatically reload
      page in framed form controllable by a tree control.</td>
