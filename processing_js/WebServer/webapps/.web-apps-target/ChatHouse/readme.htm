<h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>Chat programs are very popular at present time. You can 
find chat ability almost at any portal type web site. But, when I decided to
setup one on my web server and did a search at <i>jars.com</i>, then I have
found only three(!) servlet based chats. Other search engine gave me even worse
result. No one has satisfied my needs, so I have decided
to write my own. My implementation is not sophisticated and quite restricted,
but since it's open source it can be interesting for some people. </P>
<h3>Get started </h3>
<P>&nbsp;I made the following goals, when started the design: </P>
<ul>
  <li>No applet. I like applets much, but we could expect 
  that big players on market of browsers can drop Java soon. Another reason was 
  that some firewalls filter any Java appearance for a security purpose. And 
  finally, I have already implemented an applet based chat in the past. 
  <li>An attempt to implement a server push model. It should 
  make chat smooth as it's going on an applet versions. 
  <li>Provide good internationalization support lacked in many applet based
    chats. 
  <li>Gives possibility to do file exchange. It should be a 
  killing feature of my chat. 
  <li>No JavaScript and HTML 4.0 or to keep it minimal. 
  <li>Make it customizable as possible and even to provide WAP/WML support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>All goaled features were accomplished. Just summarize them:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Multiroom chat capabilities with possibilities as using 
  predefined rooms in specified char set as a user created rooms in default char 
  set. 
  <li>Easy navigation between rooms with displaying 
  room&nbsp; visitors. 
  <li>Locking predefined rooms by chat participants request for new visitors and 
  unlocking them when all left. 
  <li>Automatically dispose a user created room when number 
  of visitors reached 0. 
  <li>Using push server capabilities offered by Microsoft and 
  Netscape browsers with manual and automatic refresh features. Netscape 6.x 
  browsers are not supported, shame on Netscape first proposed a server push model. 
  <li>A fully customizable L&amp;F with a template based page 
  design. 
  <li>An ability to upload a file to a chat message with 
  following possibility to download the uploaded file by all chat participants 
  (GonnaSee&reg; technology). 
  <li>Switching to a private conversation with a selected chat participant. 
  <li>All chat parameters are configurable without any code 
  change. 
  <li>E-mail notification about a chat house activity including instant
    e-mailing of an invitation. 
  <li>Message board capability to publish news and other message right at front
    of the Chat House entrance. 
  <li>All in one instant installation, when you can start immediately after download
    without touching anything (Download&amp;Play&reg; technology). Preinstalled JDK 1.3
    or above is
    required.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Implementation Notices</h3>
<p>&nbsp;The implementation is pretty simple and cool (<a href="/ChatHouse/src">see
sources</a>), thanks a simple and powerful <b>DemRog</b>
class library. GonnaSee&reg; technology is based on an implementation of
multipart-form-data has been done for
<a href="http://7bee.j2ee.us/servlet_http_uploader.htm">UploadServlet</a>.
About MIME types allow server push model, see <A 
href="http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/multipart.htp">multi part content 
types</A>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Drop <a href="download/ChatHouse.war">ChatHouse.war</a> file to a servlet 
deployment directory of your J2EE servlet container.&nbsp;You can use
<a href="http://tjws.sf.net">TJWS</a> or Tomcat.
Start your browser and try to reach <a href="http://localhost/ChatHouse">http://localhost/ChatHouse</a>.
If you need modify some setting, just look in to other files provided with the
war. You can <a href="http://7bee.j2ee.us/ChatHouse/chat/Entrance">try</a> already
running version.</p>
<h3>Competitors again</h3>
<p>When I almost finish my chat program (it took less than 3 days), I have found
more servlet based chats much better quality, then I've seen initially at <i>jars.com</i>.
To my surprise, my implementation was not so bad in comparison to the best
competitor's product, as <a href="http://www.javazoom.net">jzChat</a>. I would
recommend <b>jzChat</b> to everyone, who seriously consider using servlet based
chat program on a web site. (Never use free stuff, unless you steal it.)</p>
<h3>And again</h3>
<p>You may notice that Google took my idea and implemented chat inside GMAIL. 
For some reason, GMAIL chat doesn't look so slick. Therefore I'm going to 
provide ChatHouse packaged to easy integration with any web application.</p>
