<p>jAddressBook Terms of Use</p>
<p>Welcome to jAddressBook! Before you register for your jAddressBook account, 
you must read and agree to these jAddressBook Terms of Use and the following 
terms and conditions and policies, including any future amendments 
(collectively, the &quot;Agreement&quot;):</p>
<ol>
	<li>This service is providing only for demonstration purpose. </li>
	<li>Although data stored on hardware residing in a secure facility with very 
	restricted access, there is always a risk of hardware failure, or other 
	unforeseen circumstances as earthquake, flood, fire and so on which can 
	issue data loss. So, do not store any critical data without a personal 
	backup.</li>
	<li>Although jAddressBook is unbreakable software, it runs on a regular OS 
	as Linux which can have security flaws, so can issue data theft. Therefore 
	do not store any classified data without prior encryption of them.</li>
	<li>After a period of inactivity, jAddressBook reserves the 
right to disable or terminate a user's account. If an account has been 
deactivated for inactivity, the account name associated with that account may be 
given to another user without notice to you or such other party. All deactivated 
	account data will be deleted for security reason. For more 
information on how jAddressBook deals with account inactivity, please consult 
the <a href="policies.htm">Program Policies.</a> </li>
