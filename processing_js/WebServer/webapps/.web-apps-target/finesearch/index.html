    Search engine? What can be simpler? &nbsp;Do you think so? You can 
be right though. Indexing Internet content&nbsp; although requires time and processor
recourses is quiet straight forward task.&nbsp; So where a problem is? </p>
<ol>
	<li>Keeping index up-to-date</li>
	<li>Keep index comprehensive</li>
	<li>Build categorization upon content</li>
	<li>Categorize a search query</li>
	<li>Sort and filter result</li>
	<li>Give an access to entire index</li>
	<li>Incremental and activity indexing</li>
	<li>Avoid ads or censorship driven result massaging or index building</li>
	<li>Provide request location independent result</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;What's behind every problem and how it reflects in search result? Ok, 
let's look:</p>
<h4>Keeping index up-to-date</h4>
<p>If index isn't updating periodically then a search result can contain broken 
links. It can be solved looking in search cache, however actual cause of broken 
link can be that previous version of link had incomplete or wrong information. 
Cache also doesn't allow to do drill down to get more information if it looks 
like relevant. Other case of obsolete link, that a link can be still active but 
content can not match search query.</p>
<h4>Keep index comprehensive</h4>
<p>Although web crawling is well known task, many search engines use very 
simplistic crawlers which can't handle well links calculated in JavaScript or 
links reachable from navigation trees or other navigation controls with multiple 
    states. Reason of 
that that manipulation with navigation control can just chnage its state
without bringing a new result. So many crawlers gave up 
after certain number of attempts not bringing anything different.
 Some sites, like blogs can not provide an 
index of content, like live journal. In this case search engines are not smart enough to perform 
searching tasks requiring elements of AI. Needless to say about impossibility of reaching protected 
content.</p>
<h4>Build categorization upon content</h4>
<p>Many search engine doesn't assign any categorization information to indexed 
web content. So all pages look equal. It makes search result mostly irrelevant 
to a search query.</p>
<h4>Categorize a search query</h4>
<p>Categorization a search query makes sense only if index has categorization 
too. Matching query categories to categories in an index can provide much more 
relevant results.</p>
<h4>Sort and filter result</h4>
<p>Search result should be sorted by certain criteria,&nbsp; like last time 
update, or most relevant upon used categorization. Filtering can be helpful to 
eliminate duplicated or similar result coming from the same source.</p>
<h4>Give an access to entire index</h4>
<p>Although actual number of entries matching a search query can be big, most of 
search engine will restrict a temporary built result to 1000 or less entries. It 
makes very likely that final result won't include search goal, especially if 
above problems exist in a search engine.</p>
<h4>Incremental and activity indexing</h4>
<p>Indexing can be incremental like providing changes for updated pages. 
Activity index is also helpful to find out recently changed information relevant 
to a search query.</p>
<h4>Avoid ads or censorship driven massaging</h4>
<p>Result data shouldn't be driven by advertisement pushing certain result on 
first page. Censorship shouldn't be also applied to hide certain results. Funny 
    thing that two giants as Microsoft and Google have controversial censorship 
    patterns. For example I wrote a small blog about how to use Google mail with Java mail API. Do a search for words: <samp>javamail google</samp> using Microsoft's live search 
    . A link to my blog will be second on first page. However if you try Google or 
    Yahoo search, then you won&#39;t be able to find this link at all. You may guess, 
    that Google doesn&#39;t index the blog? It isn&#39;t possible, because you can find link 
    to my article from some page found by Google. So certainly Google twit is 
    applied for my blog entry. <!-- Interesting that after publishing this discovery that
    Microsoft uses Google's twit to promote certain pages, Microsoft got excuse and shuffled
    Google's twit pages to avoid a scandal. Now my page still gets listed by Microsoft,
    however no more in first positions. --> Read more about Google censorship

<h4>Provide request location independent result</h4>
<p>Result shouldn't be build or requester location. Some engine like Google 
provides analyze of requester IP or language settings and trying to use result 
sorting based on location coefficient. A requester has to have choice to disable 
location involvement.</p>
<h3>How good Google or any other search engine are in resolving above problems?</h3>
<p>To get an answer on this question I wrote a small tool which helps in deep 
analyzing results provided by a search engine. The following score system for 
search engines was introduced:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Relevant: One or more search targets are presented in result, 0 to 5. 0 
	no search target, 1 in last 20% entries, 2 in last 50% entries, 3 in first 
	20% entries, 4 in 2 first pages, 5 on first page more than one entry.</li>
	<li>Relevant after tuning: One or more search targets are presented after 
	one search query tuning. The same scores as for one, considering as 5 if 
	tuning not required.</li>
	<li>Actuality, 0 to 3: 0 more than 20% of broken links, 1 - 10% of broken 
	links, 2 less than 5% of broken links, 3 - no broken links.</li>
	<li>Relevant actuality, 0 to 2, 0 when 50% or more of search targets broken, 1&nbsp; 
	20% to 50% of search target broken, 2 less than 20% of of search target 
	broken.</li>
	<li>Actuality, 0 to 2, 0 more than 50% of result entries do not include all 
	query words, 1 between 20%-50%, 2 less than 20%.</li>
	<li>Biased rate, 0 to 2, 0 when sites with censored words completely removed 
	from index and can't be found using other neutral words, or when 
	competitor's product can't be found on first 10 page of result, 1 when 
	censored page included in index but can't be found using censored words, 2 
	when no censorship or ads biasing.</li>
	<li>Locale involvement, 0 to 1, 0 when result depends on a requester IP or 
	locale setting, 1 not depend on.</li>
	<li>Comprehensive rate, 0-2, 0 total number of entries in query &lt; 200, 1 &lt; 
	600, 2 &lt; 1000</li>
</ol>
<p>All above tests perform for 10 different queries in the following categories:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Single word product name</li>
	<li>Single word product name and 3 words product description</li>
	<li>3 words product description</li>
	<li>5 words problem description</li>
	<li>a person name, well known</li>
	<li>a person name not well known</li>
	<li>20 words on page accessible using tree navigation</li>
	<li>20 words on page accessible JavaScript constructed link</li>
	<li>10 words page updated 10 days ago</li>
	<li>10 words page updated 30 days ago </li>
	<li>specifically selected words or product which suspected to be censored or 
	ads sensitive.</li>
	<li>providing above tests using different IP and language settings</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=155558">Download </a> <b>finesearch</b> and test 
yourself to see how bad your favorite search engine Google is. MSN search
    engine seems improving last time, results became more comprehensive and accurate.
    Yahoo is slippig. The company is busy on reorganization their software. A friend 
    of mine Yahoo&#39;s chief architect&nbsp; told me about this reason. They also hired a lot of new people who need some time to get familiar with the products of the company. I have to update recognition patterns for Yahoo every 2 months, they can't still establish output format.
Google is so so, and keeping second place. Google is still very good in software development related searches, however has very poor blog coverage. Very relevant blog entries listed by MSN on first page do not appear in Google or Yahoo search results at all.&nbsp; 
    Yahoo&#39;s crawler seems the best when working on sites with cumbersome navigation. 
    For education purpose, the tool has search support over Craig&#39;s list. Please use 
    this feature with precaution and do not abuse Craig&#39;s list.</p>
<p>Finesearch is easy deployable on such app servers as TJWS, Tomcat, or Sun 
Java(TM) System Application Server. However binary of Finesearch is prepackaged 
with
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35209">TJWS</a>, 
so you do not need to bother downloading and installing anything else. Just type 
<kbd>java -jar finesearch.jar</kbd> and select URL
<a href="http://localhost:8080/finesearch">http://localhost:8080/finesearch</a> 
in your browser. If you have port 8080 conflict, then edit
<font face="Courier New"><b>rundescriptor</b></font> inside of jar specifying a 
different port number. </p>
<p>Note that due instability of SF.net CVS, I decided to move CVS repository to my 
home machine. So SF.net <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=155558">CVS tree</a> 
doesn't reflect the latest project code status. I'll try to provide weekly 
builds to allow get changes faster.</p>
<h3>How to promote your company, product or service without spending a penny when people 
still use Google ?</h3>
<p>It's quite easy and will take just few minutes with Search Director, so even 
if your time is very valuable, you still can save hundred dollars on payment to 
Google. I'll provide a step by step instruction on a simple example.</p>
<h4>Initial task</h4>
<p>I have a Java build tool and want to get it reachable for people who're 
trying to choose a building tool. I've created a home page for this build tool 
at <a href="http://7bee.j2ee.us/bee/index-bee.html">
http://7bee.j2ee.us/bee/index-bee.html</a> . The tool name is <b>7Bee</b>. </p>
<h4>Verify that your target can be found using direct name search</h4>
<p>Generally this step is optional, because even if your page not listed on 
direct name search, then following to next steps of the remedy plan you have a 
good chance to get it listed and generate traffic to it.</p>
<h4>Verify that your target can't be found at a simple relevant search</h4>
<p>Run Search Director an use relevant query like java build tool. Add a 
filtering rule with a name of your product, like 7bee in our case. make sure 
that result produced by a search engine didn't bring any entry on your product. 
There is no surprise.</p>
<h4>Find a content in search result you can change</h4>
<p>Blogs, forums, surveys, visitors lists, encyclopedias, and any other type of 
pages allowing content management are your target. (You do not need to hack in WebDav or 
something like that.) Use filtering words like blog, forum 
survey, and so on to find such pages. You can also filter out direct competitor's pages by specifying
their product names with low count value, like 1-2. Doing that 
I found two pages looked promising as: </p>
<ol>
	<li>A poll page from
	<a href="http://www.manageability.org/polls/what-is-your-favorite-java-build-tool">
	http://www.manageability.org/polls/what-is-your-favorite-java-build-tool</a> 
	This page asked to add your favorite Java build tool unless it's already 
	listed. So I have added my tool 7Bee on this page. Manageability page was 
	very good catch since it was entry number 3 of Google's result.</li>
	<li>Another page was found as blog of
	<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/sayedh/">Sayed Hashimi's </a>&nbsp;at
	<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/sayedh/archive/2005/10/your_build_tool.html">
	http://weblogs.java.net/blog/sayedh/archive/2005/10/your_build_tool.html</a> 
	. This page allowed to leave a comment, so I left it about 7Bee build tool. 
	Ranking of this page not quite well, it has number&nbsp; 356 in Google's 
	result, so very unlikely somebody ever will open it. However Google generates 
	3 entries for this page, so it made me think that this page is popular in 
	other searches and people can get know 7Bee without a targeted search.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Enjoy seeing your product by search engines</h4>
<p>After remedy actions defined in previous steps I could see my tool listed 
instantly in search results. Although search engines as Google still do not 
provide direct links to a product, it doesn't seem like bad, because a mention of 
the product can be found in first page of any relevant search.</p>
<p>I used the same technique to promote my servlet container which currently 
listed as 2nd entry of Google's result. Without usage of this tool it wasn't 
listed at all. Needless to mention that nothing required to make my 
products listed by MSN search within 2 first pages of a result. Certainly MSN 
produces much less biased and more relevant results. MSN search is just lacking 
in search of problem solving pages. So Google wins here. It looks like internally Google can have a 
good ranking mechanism, however it's completely destroyed by ads. </p>
    <h4>
        Time passed, things changed</h4>
    <div>
        You need to repeat the described procedure to keep you listed on first result pages
        of popular search engines. Google seems lost interest to blog of Sayed and Manageably
        site withdrew this page either. However a 3 minutes procedure returned status quo.
        I got listed again. Google seems hiring more engineers from India, so my product
        listed on Indian sites turned on visibility on Google's pages as well. Microsoft
        seems got an interest to Sayed, so my tool again survived.  Sayed is also loved
        by Yahoo probably he moved from Google there, who knows?</div>
<h3>Design principles of a right search engine</h3>
<p>You're already aware those multiple problems of widely used search engines. So, 
is there any solution to avoid problems and create a right one? Certainly a 
solution exists and not one. I and my group are working on a new generation of 
search engines. We name it as an intelligent search engine, although it's 
probably too much. I'd like to share with you some design principles and hope to 
get some feedback from you, because you will be all users of the new search 
engine quite soon. I have also opennings in my group, so if you feel smart enough,
then welcome to join. So, how does it work?</p>
<ul>
	<li>All words of English language (we count around 12,000) get 
	categorization index (sure other languages will coming soon).&nbsp; A word 
	can have more than one categorization index (it's obvious). </li>
	<li>Every crawled web site obtains a categorization index based on 
	categorization indices of words found on it. Obviously web site can get more 
	than one.</li>
	<li>Words are not falling in any categorization indices considered as names 
	and for names we build also weak categorization indices. </li>
	<li>Every categorization index has weight, it allows to order categorization 
	indices in a request. A word with highest weight of categorization index 
	names as a leading request word.</li>
	<li>A search query processed first upon categorization indices of words 
	starting from a leading word and going down. Finally a result after applying 
	categorization out line is used for finding not categorized words as names 
	and others.</li>
	<li>Working on improving categorization of search index we improve your 
	search results.</li>
